## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gogamar/s1_2_bootstrap_sass.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd s1_2_bootstrap_sass
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use npm to install Bootstrap and SASS by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command installs the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file:

   - **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework for responsive design.
   - **SASS**: A CSS preprocessor for writing modular and maintainable CSS.

4. **Run the Build Script**:
   To compile your SASS files into CSS, use the following npm script:
   ```bash
   npm run build-css
   ```
   This command executes the SASS compiler to convert your `scss/main.scss` file into a CSS file located at `css/style.css`, and it will watch for changes so that it recompiles automatically as you edit your SASS files.

## Execution

To run the project locally use **Live Server** extension for Visual Studio Code.
